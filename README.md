Mean Filtering and Median Filtering with Matlab programming language

# MEAN FİLTER

  The averaging filter is a filtering method used to clean images and reduce noise. Blurs the image.
The idea of average filtering is to replace each pixel value in an image with the average value of its neighbors, including itself. That is, all the values in the matrix are added together and divided by the number of squares and the average value is found. The average value now replaces the middle value (ie the box next to everyone). The occurrence of this mathematical event is also called the average filter.

# MEDİAN FİLTER

  Median Filtering method is also a filtering method used to clean the image like mean. For example, if there are white dots in a black image, we can delete these white dots with the median.
In Median Filtering, for example, let's say we have a 3x3 matrix. These matrices are ordered starting from one edge and the most common value in the order is now the middle value of our matrix.
